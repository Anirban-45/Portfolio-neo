                        - The timing and sources of transport are often unknown to the people.  <br/>
                        - In the end, the fair system redesignation has made people confused about how much they should be charged for their rides. <br/><br/>

                        Jatayat tries to merge these into a few solutions to provide a thorough guide to the users. By tracking the schedules of the transports and implementing a user-based continuous traffic update it tries to give details information and reasons for congestion. As well as the map will always be accessible to check routes and pathways of public transport and how much time it will take. Finally, a fare calculator could be integrated into the system to properly determine the fare according to the distance and rides.

                            This project was handed to me while in the v1.4 update. Ans I was supposed to redesign the application. As of then, no User Experience designer was not available, and most of the UI parts were handled by the developers and product managers themselves. But for the latest version, they opted to put in a few efforts in actually getting proper market research and redesigning the UI as a whole.

So the product team went to take a small user interview. But firstly, we've thought of creating user personas to rule out a user's basic concerns. From the many personas, we have created something that stood out. That a newsfeed for the people is very necessary. As the support that people require in road-based issues in regularity can be solved the best by other people. And with help from a few or many intermediates, this can stand out to be a social reporting system that uses the users' curiosity as a tool to provide ease.</p>

                                <p style={{lineHeight: "25px"}}>Overviewing the app it seems the users get a bit confused about the technical features. As most of the apps on the market show a map and have a certain property to utilize the map as the center of their features. However, the central map hides a few of the features that the users were supposed to access. And for that, they were not able to harness the full potential and often get lost between the pages of the application. And thus this needed a revamp. <br/> Going through the documentation we see a severe lack of information i.e. the number of bus stops, the coordinates of bus stops, bus details, route convergences, etc. These pieces of information were very necessary to be input to find a proper way to display them in the application. the fare calculator was also not working properly because of the lack of provided locations. So a handful of people were designated to physically and digitally gather this information and store it in a database. <br/><br/> The latter issue to be addressed was the posts. We had to decide a way to put the posts in such a way that it is visible to the average users but also are not distracting to the eye so that the main wants are not unattained. The create post section was thought to be kept short due to the lack of time a user might have in their way of commute. And the rest of the details would be extracted either from the interactions or the various user profiles.</p>

                                        <p>Most of the options were in the side menus and thus were not automatically visible to the tab of the app. Very many people notified that they could not find the fare calculator function.</p>

                                In this case, we created the new wireframes. Firstly, I decided to provide larger Icons in front of the apps to show off the features and then incorporate the map with the location insert mechanics. We thought about creating a feed feature to designate as the post viewer page.
